You are given a string "S" and you have to determine whether it is Valid mobile number or not. Mobile number is valid only if it is of length 10 , consists of numeric values and it shouldn't have prefix zeroes.

Input:
First line of input is T representing total number of test cases.
Next T line each representing "S" as described in in problem statement.

Output:
Print "YES" if it is valid mobile number else print "NO".
Note: Quotes are for clarity.
Constraints:
1<= T <= 103
sum of string length <= 105

SAMPLE INPUT

0123456789
0123456.87
SAMPLE OUTPUT
